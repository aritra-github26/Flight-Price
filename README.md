# Flight Price Prediction

This project aims to predict flight prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical flight data, we can build a model that can accurately estimate the price of a flight based on various factors such as departure time, airline, route, and more.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Flight-Price.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Flight-Price`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use the flight price prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your flight data in a CSV format.
2. Load the trained model using the provided script: `python load_model.py`
3. Provide the necessary inputs to the model, such as departure time, airline, route, etc.
4. Get the predicted flight price as the output.

## Data

The flight data used for this project is sourced from various airlines and travel agencies. It includes information such as departure time, arrival time, airline, route, and price. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or missing values.

## Model Training

The flight price prediction model is trained using a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest Regression. This algorithm is chosen for its ability to handle both numerical and categorical features effectively. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the flight prices are the target variable.

## Evaluation

The performance of the flight price prediction model is evaluated using various metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared score. These metrics help assess the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions.
